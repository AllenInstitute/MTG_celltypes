# Human cortical cell types
Code to generate figures for the manuscript "Conserved cell types with divergent features between human and mouse cortex" describing transcriptomic cell types in adult human neocortex.


## Notes
* Run "Code_0_prepareComparisonDataSets" and then "Code_1_buildDendrogram" prior to running other scripts, which can be run in any order (Support... functions do not need to be run)
* The two "Code_metaNeighbor" take several hours to several days to run, while the other scripts are relatively fast
* Several files need to be downloaded and unzipped prior to running code, as explained in "Code_0_prepareComparisonDataSets" and "Code_correlationWithOtherDatasets.r"
